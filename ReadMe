There are new test methods written one is for web and another is for command line
The API is returning the temparature values for every 3 hours
and some values for the same day is matching with 2 or more conditions and hence i printed every thing as per the response from api
For the web application as it was supposed to return a table i can convert it in to a json object or xml object so that 
it will become easy to handle from the web application
i have not done the implementation of conversion of xml or json as i am describing only the approach here
